## Practical-HTML-CSS-Examples

---

Some useful sketches, before going through advanced topic of web-design,   
that have been created by myself when I was practicing **HTML-CSS**.    
In my opinion, it is better learning **HTML-CSS** well, then learning **JavaScript**.   
Therefor, **none** of these examples have `js` code.    
Also, inside each directory you can find a screenshot of that page.  

Good luck.
